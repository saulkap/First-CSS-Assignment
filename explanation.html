      Controller, and Sentinel. They're all made for differnet purposes.
      Initiators are made to gather information like locations of enemies or
      delay enemies. Sentinels are defense orientated characters. Controllers
      are made to block line of sights using smoke screens. Duelists are made to
      push the objectives and create space for their team.
