      <!-- Elaboration of how the valorant acts work inside the paragraph -->
      <p>
        In valorant there is a total of 22 ranks in 8 different divisions with
        sub-divisions, each sub-division has 3 levels with 1 being the worst and
        3 being the best. The lowest rank obtainable in valorant is "Iron 1",
        the highest obtainable rank is "Radiant". Radiant has no sub-divisions
        and contains the top 500 players from that region (EU, Asia, NA, etc).

      <!-- Explaining how the ranking works and how the rr system works -->
      <p>
        To rank up or down in valorant you must gain or lose "rr", which stands
        for rank rating. The amount of rr you gain or lose is determined by your
        solo performance in a game. If you perform very well in a game it does
        not matter if you win or lose you will gain a "performance bonus". This
        basically means you gain more rr or lose less depending on if you won or
        lost the match

        alt="Valorant Act rank system example image"
      />
      <!-- Explaining how valorant act ranks work and how theyre ranked -->
      <p>
        On top of valorants base ranks there is something called an act rank.
        After your 5 placement matches you get your base rank, from there each
        win and loss is marked on the pyramid shown in the image. Your act rank
        is your overall for that act.
