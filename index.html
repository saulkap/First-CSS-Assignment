      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        Valorant is a team based shooter so its a good idea to find a good team to
        play with. Unfortunately for me that teammate is
        <span class="cohen">Cohen</span>. <br />
        You may be wondering why is that a bad thing? I can show you exactly why,
        Exhibit A:
      </p>
      <div id="Cohen Exhibit A">
      <video
        src="Video/Actually throwing.mov"
        alt="Video of cohen brutally murdering me."
        autoplay
        controls
        height="500px"
      ></video>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        This video shows <span class="cohen">Cohen</span>(the one throwing fire)
        killing me(the one in the corner) while on my rankup game. This isn't the
        only reason, allow me to explain further.<br />
        Exhibit B:
      </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Cohen Exhibit B">
      <video
        src="Video/crosshair.mov"
        alt="Video of Cohens awful crosshair"
        autoplay
        controls
        height="500px"
      ></video>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        This is <span class="cohen">Cohen</span> crosshair he created while we
        played, it's called "throwing". In this clip he gets lucky and gets 2
        kills, he usually just dies. But this isn't all he does. <br />
        Exhibit C:
      </p>
      </div>
      <div id="Cohen Exhibit C">
      <video
        src="Video/actually just bad.mov"
        alt="Video of Cohen missing on idle person"
        autoplay
        controls
        height="500px"
      ></video>
      <p class="paragraphs">
        This clip is <span class="cohen">Cohen</span> flashing someone, giving him
        every advantage over them, and still missing his shots. Why or how he
        managed this? The world will never know. I know what you're thinking, he
        does all this? No, but this is enough examples to get the idea.
